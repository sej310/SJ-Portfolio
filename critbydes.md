I selected this particular data visualization because selfishly it was one of the first visualizations I saw that was interesting to me. As a want to be dog owner, I thought it was really interesting the data that was collected was displayed and how many features go into displaying popularity and value of various dog breeds. I felt that this would be a light and fun way to work with some data for this homework assignment. 

# Visualization Process Reflection

This was one of the hardest assignment, truly, that I have done so far at Heinz. Not only did this really stretch me creativly, but I underestimated the time and thought it takes into arranging data the way you envision it to be arranged. After completing the critique, I felt empowered and ready to jump into designing. However, I realized that one of my main critiques is that there was so much data that my visualization needed to be paired down. After talking with my roommate and friends about the best ways to tell a story with the data given, I really had my heart set on a bullet box chart showing the popularity of various dog breeds compared to the lifetime cost to keep that dog breed healthy. 

It wasn't until I started playing around in Data wrapper that the scale of popularity was not the same as price (popularity being only on a scale of 1 - 160 and price averaging around $20k). I was incredibly frustrated trying to play with the scale and how to order the graph that I had spent a few hours trying to figure out how to get my dream accomplished. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to get my dream to come into fruititon and settled on my second option: the comparison of life lived and the cost of life. What was interesting was that the graph had an upward trend, which I never really thought about until I saw the data and the story that it was telling. This assignment was incredibly valuable not only to realize that sometimes your design dreams can't come true, and that another story is waiting to be told if you're patient and have the time to try out other options.
