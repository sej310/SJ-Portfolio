I selected this particular data visualization because selfishly it was one of the first visualizations I saw that was interesting to me. As a want to be dog owner, I thought it was really interesting the data that was collected was displayed and how many features go into displaying popularity and value of various dog breeds. I felt that this would be a light and fun way to work with some data for this homework assignment.
