# Final Project

# Part I
   #  Outline

I will be visualizing the outcome of Kappa Delta Sorority's legacy data for the Fall 2019 recruitment season. Encompassing over 80 chapters accross 32 states, it is imparative to understand the journey of a legacy to help better articulate to alumnae members the reality of recruitment. For project context, a legacy is a woman who is seeking sorority membership whose sister, mother, or grandmother is a member in good standing from any Kappa Delta chapter. In the Fall 2019 season, 1,274 legacies went through the recruitment process and of those women, 460 joined Kappa Delta. 

Major project elements I would like to include for my project are to showcase the realities of women entering in recruitment. Historically, our organization has had record highs with the amount of women qulifying as legacies, and statistically, chapters often times cannot accept all legacies. From the data that I have, there are about one-third of legacies that pledge Kappa Delta chapters and I am curious why. Is it because we choose not to invite back women throughout recruitment? Is it because she prefers another group instead? The call to action that I hope to accomplish with this project is to educate the reality and likeliness of a daughter, sister, or granddaughter pledging the same organization our alumnae members have. 

   # Initial Sketches

![Invitations to Preference](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57073608/69018626-3dc26980-097b-11ea-8b22-6d2f59226869.jpeg)

The first graph explores the relationship of the preference round, the final round of all recruitments. This chart shows the three categories of outcomes that could happen to a legacy: invited and accepted, invited and regretted, or she is "released" or not invited to Preference round. I want to show the varience between a legacy's connection (whether its mother, sister, or grandmother) and if she is an out of state or instate woman going through recruitment. My prediction is that you are more likely to be invited and accepted if you are an instate candidiate.

The next graph shows where legacy candidates pledge if they do not pledge Kappa Delta. I'm really curious about the regional strength and preference of other sororities. My prediction is that groups like Chi Omega and Delta Delta Delta are regionally stronger in the southeast where as groups such as Alpha Phi and Gamma Phi Beta have a stronger presence in the West Coast.  


   # Data

This project contains a unique data source. In order to collect legacy data, information is collected from the recruitment chairs of each chapter and is up to the discression of self reporting on the legacy. Spreadsheets are collected individually and sent to each division's Chapter Membership Specialist (CMS) to check for accuracy. Once approved, the spreadsheet gets sent to the Chapter Membership Manager of Specail Projects (CMMSP) who collects and manages all chapter legacy information. As I collected data for the project, there were a ton of variances in completion between chapters and divisions. Due to the unresponsivness of some chapters, not all data that I would like to analyze is present in the data set, particularily a specific region of the country I'm more curious in analyzing. 

In the [data set](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v9Me29Uc3qswu1SFHU3SZmuPwNWHQopV/view?usp=sharing), you will see your basic information such as name, status in school, hometown and state, and their legacy connection (whether mother, sister, grandmother, or great grandmother). Towards the middle of the sheet, you have 3 various types of data collected: a legacy introduction form, number of recommendations, and if a legacy has claimed her status on Campus Director, a popular recruitment registration database. This helps validate a legacy's status by having her self-reporting her status on Campus Director or having her legacy connection fill out a legacy introduction form on behalf of her. Recommendations are used an ancillary support for a legacy, and to help provide validation of her relationship. After the GPA column, there are various rounds that indicate action done by the chapter and legacy in tandum. For example, the denotion "Invited/Attended" indicates that a chapter invited a legacy to the next round of recruitment, and the legacy accepted that invitation by attending. There are some campuses that only host 3 rounds of recruitment instead of 4, therefore Round 4 is left blank. Lastly, the sheet provides information to whether a legacy has multiple family connections and if she did not pledge Kappa Delta, which sorority she pledged instead. The last remaining columns about the chapter that the sheet is from, the division the chapter is in, and the state the chapter is located in were added from original sheets for easy data comparisons. 



   # Method & Medium

I plan to build my story design in Shorthand for the final project. I'm excited to play around within the platform and discover more ways to tell this story through multiple perspectives: from an alumnae view, from a legacy view, and from the chapter view. I have some areas that I would like to dig in further such as the likelihood of pledging a chapter based off of your GPA, whether some geographic regions of the country are more friendly to legacies, and whether an alumnae's current chapter status (i.e. inactive, probation, good standing) has an effect on the likeliness of their legacy to be accepted. I would love to also explore through a geographic map to see where legacies are traveling to go to school and whether that affects their chances of pledging Kappa Delta. 

Because this concept is niche, I will preface before my presentation that this would be a presentation from industry professionals with 5+ years of experience. I am unsure whether or not it would be beneficial to have a vocabulary slide to quickly eliminate the language barrier, however, I aim in my visualization to avoid this at all possible. 




# Part II
  # Wireframing & Story Board

I started thinking about ways to draft the story and started at the root as to why this informtion was being collected. By starting with the intial introduction as to the why, I was able to follow my stream of consciousness and articulate where my story was going. Listed below is the original storyboard I drew out to collect an initial sketch of where I invisioned the project.



After layout out the initial story board, I wanted to provide some space for thought to make sure all aspects of the story or pieces I wanted to analyze was avaliable. I walked through my wireframe again, making sure that all pieces of the project were captured, and created each graph as I went throughout the storyboard. Below, I have included intitial versions of the graphs before talking with peers about revisions.
