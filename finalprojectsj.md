# Final Project


# Outline

I will be visualizing the outcome of Kappa Delta Sorority's legacy data for the Fall 2019 recruitment season. Encompassing over 80 chapters accross 32 states, it is imparative to understand the journey of a legacy to help better articulate to alumnae members the reality of recruitment. For project context, a legacy is a woman who is seeking sorority membership whose sister, mother, or grandmother is a member in good standing from any Kappa Delta chapter. In the Fall 2019 season, 1,274 legacies went through the recruitment process and of those women, 460 joined Kappa Delta. 

Major project elements I would like to include for my project are ______________________

# Data

This project contains a unique data source. In order to collect legacy data, information is collected from the recruitment chairs of each chapter.

# Method & Medium

I plan to build my story design in Shorthand for the final project. I'm excited to play around within the platform and discover more ways to tell this story through multiple perspectives: from an alumnae view, from a legacy view, and from the chapter view. Because this concept is niche, I will preface before my presentation that this would be a presentation from industry professionals with 5+ years of experience. I am unsure whether or not it would be beneficial to have a vocabulary slide to quickly eliminate the language barrier, however, I aim in my visualization to avoid this at all possible.
