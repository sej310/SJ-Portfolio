# Final Project


# Outline

I will be visualizing the outcome of Kappa Delta Sorority's legacy data for the Fall 2019 recruitment season. Encompassing over 80 chapters accross 32 states, it is imparative to understand the journey of a legacy to help better articulate to alumnae members the reality of recruitment. For project context, a legacy is a woman who is seeking sorority membership whose sister, mother, or grandmother is a member in good standing from any Kappa Delta chapter. In the Fall 2019 season, 1,274 legacies went through the recruitment process and 460 women joined Kappa Delta.
