# Final Project


# Outline

I will be visualizing the outcome of Kappa Delta Sorority's legacy data for the Fall 2019 recruitment season. Encompassing over 80 chapters accross 32 states, it is imparative to understand the journey of a legacy to help better articulate to alumnae members the reality of recruitment. For project context, a legacy is a woman who is seeking sorority membership whose sister, mother, or grandmother is a member in good standing from any Kappa Delta chapter. In the Fall 2019 season, 1,274 legacies went through the recruitment process and of those women, 460 joined Kappa Delta. 

Major project elements I would like to include for my project are ______________________

# Data

This project contains a unique data source. In order to collect legacy data, information is collected from the recruitment chairs of each chapter and is up to the discression of self reporting on the legacy. 

In the [data set](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v9Me29Uc3qswu1SFHU3SZmuPwNWHQopV/view?usp=sharing), you will see your basic information such as name, status in school, hometown and state, and their legacy connection (whether mother, sister, grandmother, or great grandmother). Towards the middle of the sheet, you have 3 various types of data collected: a legacy introduction form, number of recommendations, and if a legacy has claimed her status on Campus Director, a popular recruitment registration database. 



# Method & Medium

I plan to build my story design in Shorthand for the final project. I'm excited to play around within the platform and discover more ways to tell this story through multiple perspectives: from an alumnae view, from a legacy view, and from the chapter view. I have some areas that I would like to dig in further such as the likelihood of pledging a chapter based off of your GPA, whether some geographic regions of the country are more friendly to legacies, and whether an alumnae's current chapter status (i.e. inactive, probation, good standing) has an effect on the likeliness of their legacy to be accepted. I would love to also explore through a geographic map to see where legacies are traveling to go to school and whether that affects their chances of pledging Kappa Delta. 

Because this concept is niche, I will preface before my presentation that this would be a presentation from industry professionals with 5+ years of experience. I am unsure whether or not it would be beneficial to have a vocabulary slide to quickly eliminate the language barrier, however, I aim in my visualization to avoid this at all possible.
